# SocWorkApp

SocWorkApp is an API for a social network web application. In this application users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. This application has been built using Express.js for routing, has a MongoDB databse, and uses a JavaScript date library. To get a a better idea of how this application works please refer to the video demonstration link below. To view all the code or contact me visit my GitHub page.
